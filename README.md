# NeurIPS_Data_DN_Detection

This repository contains datasets for **line failures** and **cyber attacks** in **power distribution networks**, developed for research purposes and suitable for benchmarking anomaly detection or fault localization models.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

The repository includes:
- Synthetic datasets simulating **line failures** in distribution networks using OpenDSS
- Datasets simulating **cyber-physical attacks**, including PV system attacks, EV charging station attacks, and voltage sensor attacks
- Folder-wise descriptions and associated metadata files

## ðŸ§  Motivation

Distribution networks are increasingly exposed to both natural failures (e.g., line faults due to extreme weather) and intentional cyber threats. These datasets aim to support:
- Development of robust detection and diagnostic tools
- Facilitate resilience improvement in smart grids
- Enhance research in outage/anomaly detection, graph learning in power systems
