## ðŸ“‚ Contents

This folder includes synthetic dataset generation code using OpenDSS to support the development and evaluation of intelligent resilience solutions in power distribution networks. Specifically, it contains code for generating:

- **Line Failure Datasets**: Simulated scenarios of physical line outages under various fault conditions
- **Cyber-Physical Attack Datasets**: Includes attacks targeting:
  - Photovoltaic (PV) systems
  - Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS)
  - Voltage/current sensors
- Accompanying metadata and structured folder-wise descriptions

## ðŸ§  Motivation

With the growing deployment of distributed energy resources and digitization of grid infrastructure, distribution networks face increasing exposure to both:
- **Natural disruptions** such as line failures caused by storms, wildfires, or equipment degradation
- **Cyber-physical threats** targeting DERs, sensors, and control devices

This dataset collection is designed to:
- Enable the development and benchmarking of robust detection and diagnostic algorithms
- Support research in graph-based learning, outage localization, and anomaly detection
- Promote improved situational awareness and resilience strategies for smart grids
