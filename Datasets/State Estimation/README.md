# State Estimation Dataset

This folder contains code for generating datasets for evaluating state estimation methods in unbalanced power distribution networks. These datasets include time-series voltage measurements under varying operating conditions, generated using OpenDSS simulations of standard IEEE feeders.

The goal is to support the development of learning-based and hybrid approaches for estimating system states (e.g., nodal voltage magnitudes) using limited and noisy sensor measurements.
